## Downloading

Please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ConnorDY/OSRS-Environment-Exporter/releases) page to download the application.

We recommend using the latest release unless you are having problems with it.

## How to use

If you're on Windows, double click `run.bat` to launch the application.

If you're on macOS or Linux, open a terminal window, change directory to where you extracted the application, then execute the following command: `./run`.

[TheSkulled](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3NPPMYWrCH4oCFeKRf9Ltw) made a lovely [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhqLDY9QH7k) for the exporter. Give it a watch! ðŸ‘€

## Troubleshooting

If the application does not run, make sure you have JDK 11 or newer installed.

OpenJDK can be downloaded [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download).

To check which version of Java you have installed, open Command Prompt (or a terminal window if you're on Linux or macOS) and run the following command:
```bash
java --version
```

| `power-saving-mode`        | `Boolean` | `false`          | If enabled, will attempt to keep the idle frame rate as low as possible without impacting usability.                                                                                                         |

| `sample-shading`           | `Boolean` | `false`          | If enabled, tells OpenGL to shade sub-samples in MSAA (OpenGL 4.0+).                                                                                                                                         |
